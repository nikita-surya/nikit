abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in critical
  systems, where robustness and alignment are crucial. In this context, the field
  of explainable artificial intelligence has proposed the generation of high-level
  explanations of the prediction process of CNNs through concept extraction. While
  these methods can detect whether or not a concept is present in an image, they are
  unable to determine its location. What is more, a fair comparison of such approaches
  is difficult due to a lack of proper validation procedures. To address these issues,
  we propose a novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based
  on representations obtained through pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps.
  Further, we introduce a process for the quantitative comparison and validation of
  concept-extraction techniques based on synthetic datasets with pixel-wise annotations
  of their main components, mitigating possible confirmation biases induced by human
  visual inspection. Extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets
  demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.
